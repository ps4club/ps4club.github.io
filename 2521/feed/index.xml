					<description><![CDATA[It absolutely is. I only got a PS4 back in 2018 after seeing Cory Barlog&#039;s live reaction to the God of War reviews.

But since then, I grabbed a load of the classics. Including Horizon Zero Dawn.

I&#039;ve played it maybe 2-3 times, but have been holding off on another playthrough until we get a new TV.

I&#039;ve been using my almost 10yo, 47&quot; LG 1080p 3D TV, but we have a glorious 65&quot; Samsung UHD HDR TV arriving on Wednesday morning!

I cannot wait to replay all the games!!!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[this is one of those games where i like to put a dozen or so hours into then lose interest, only to pick it up again later.

&#038;#x200B;

for me, i kinda like some of the earlier exploring, i love hunting down animals and machines for upgrades, hell i even like the stuff like farming the emu looking machines for echo canisters or whatever - i also enjoy the themes and some of the idealistic choices, like the new people having a sort of native american/primitive man sort of society as well as a more established empire ish style thing, low tech hunting and high tech targets is interesting, etc.

but, i&#039;ll get some copies of some weapons and the best skills, mod them for specific purposes, like a hunter bow with handling is all that&#039;s needed, but a carja sharpshot bow modded with damage, another with tear, swapped in and out with the same slot, is great, and more notably the armor collecting and modding, not unlike BOTW, which i have similar issues with - too much space, too little use of it, kinda.

and feel like there&#039;s not a whole lot more i can do to &#039;improve&#039; really, and kinda lose interest - more of a gameplay over all kinda guy, the story&#039;s great i&#039;m just not a story guy, and i kinda have issues with how big some open world games are this gen, to the point they kinda bum me out some (i mean, remember the trip to the sun city, that took for fucking ever), and after like 10-15 hours, if i can&#039;t really look forward to getting new gear or whatnot, it&#039;s just the same sort of gameplay i&#039;d already been doing for half a day, with some story stuff that i&#039;m not exactly into.]]></description>
