					<description><![CDATA[I have just over 1700 trophies (level 250), over PS3 &#038; PS4. Also 11 platinums:

* Death Stranding 
* Dragon Quest Builders 2 
* Horizon Zero Dawn 
* inFamous 2 (PS3) 
* Mass Effect
* Mass Effect 2
* No Man&#039;s Sky 
* Saints Row 3 (PS3) 
* Skyrim
* Skyrim (PS3) 
* Spider-Man 

For me platinums are just an excuse to keep playing a game after the main story. I think most of the above list were pretty straightforward, but there was a &#039;Dragon Quest Builders 2&#039; trophy for dog breeding that was pain. Not difficult, just annoying.

I took a break from &#039;Mass Effect 3&#039;, but I&#039;ll probably try and get its platinum to wrap up the Trilogy.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Damn, I’m level 303 with just over 3000 trophies. I haven’t looked at that in awhile. I did just platinum Ghost of Tsushima which brings me to a total of 6 platinums since PS3. Seems kind of sad when I think about it that way lol
 EDIT: I just realized my platinums on Control, Odyssey, and Ghost of Tsushima are all since my kids were born just over a year ago. I guess even though my time is more limited it’s more focused now. I don’t want to jump to new games till I’ve exhausted what I’m playing bc I know I’ll never get back to it lol]]></description>
