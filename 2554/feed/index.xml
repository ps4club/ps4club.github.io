					<description><![CDATA[Great story to the point where each death doesn&#039;t feel like as much a restart as a way to progress and learn more about what&#039;s going on. Also the fact that characters will comment on your last run is a great touch. All gods/characters you meet along the way are very interesting. Not a boring character in sight.

Great gameplay. Lots of customization on each run. Variety of Weapons, each with several forms which make them feel different. Combat feels smooth and fluid but most importantly well balanced. Personally it&#039;s one of the best roguelikes I&#039;ve ever played and I love The Binding of Isaac but this has overtaken that in my books. Plus I love Greek myth so that&#039;s an added bonus.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It deserves the hype. Top notch gameplay that&#039;s challenging but always fair, a great well written story and superb production values. Rarely does a game hit on all cylinders and Supergiant deserves all the praise Hades has received.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[An actual narrative which many roguelikes/roguelites tend to skip out on, driven by a great cast of characters that successfully alleviates the typically associated sense of failure with every death. It has a remarkable amount of replayability owing to incredibly deep build diversity that rewards and encourages creativity and perseverance. And it features a typically fantastic job from Darren Korb not only in his OST composition but in his greater role of audio director as well (I&#039;m guessing all of the VA casting and direction went through him). And all of it neatly wrapped up and polished to a blinding shine that puts many AAA games to shame. I cannot stress enough how well presented and realised this game is. 

I probably got about 100 hours out of it by the time I got the platinum, and intend to keep playing it. For £20 it was an absolute steal.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I had 3...maybe 4 failed starts on hades.  I could see it was a solid game.  But there was always something else going on in life, and because of the &#039;pick up and play immediately&#039; nature of the game, I found it was also very easy to put down.  But that was on me and my circumstances.

I kinda don&#039;t have much on for the next few weeks and rather than replay something I was like, nah, I&#039;ll try bang out hades before metroid dread releases.  The game is fucking crisp.  I&#039;m EVER so close to my first escape.  The story is picking up, and I&#039;ve heard it gets much better.

My only advice or recommendation, besides definitely getting it hehe, would be to ignore because it&#039;s so easy to pick up and play it&#039;s also quite easy to put down mentality that I developed.  Like, really give it some cracks.  Cause I&#039;m having so much fun now.  That I regret a little stopping to do other stuff or play other stuff rather, obviously real life has to come first.  At least for me.

Rambled a bit there, but I hope it made some lick of sense.  It IS an incredibly polished, tight, fun as fuck experience.  

I&#039;m not sure if I&#039;ll go for the penultimate ending yet.   Might just do a few and see if the story grabs me more, which my mate said it should.  I&#039;d like to be finished with it before metroid releasing so, who knows 

Have fun TC. Oh, and the voice acting is absolute S tier.   It&#039;s hard to believe it&#039;s an Indie studio that did this game.  Though if say it&#039;s one of the considerably larger, or, &#039;Well funded&#039; indie studio&#039;s.

Enjoy!]]></description>
