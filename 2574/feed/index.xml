					<description><![CDATA[Played it for a while but got bored with it and never finished. The map feels huge, but never feels like there&#039;s a reason for it to be so big. Not much variety. Taking outposts was fun and that&#039;s about all I got out of it before putting it down. Performance on PS4 also sucks, it has a choppy framerate. It was fun while it lasted, just not enough got me to want to finish the game.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Personally I love it. I played FC2 and appreciated it for what it was, more of a survival game than a FPS by today&#039;s standards. 

FC3 came out and gave us the additional save spots, gunplay, while still keeping the jungle vibe and world setting. All of the weapons are polished and have a decent selection. Also the bad guy is memorable and quotable. FC3 was improved upon again by FC4 with an additional gun slot and stuff you&#039;ll say, &quot;damn I wish 3 had this&quot;. 

Play it, it&#039;s a great game. If you played 4 or 5 then you&#039;ll notice what&#039;s missing from 3, but if you haven&#039;t then I believe you&#039;ll thoroughly enjoy it going in blind without those to compare it too. 

Also when you finish is watch the Christopher Mintz Plasse far cry 3 mini movie on YouTube because, again VAS the bad guy is a fucking amazing character. 

Also all the DLC for these games are entertaining, colorful, creative. Bad Dragon is the one for 3 so check it out!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It’s my favorite FC game. I’ve played them all, but 3 always sticks out to me. 

5 I never finished because of how they force progress and then once you complete a regions bunker mission it eliminates all world enemies from that region making returning to that region to free roam pointless because there’s no enemies anymore. 

4 was a step up from 3 and I liked it, but for some reason I always go back to 3.]]></description>
