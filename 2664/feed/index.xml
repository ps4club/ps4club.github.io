					<description><![CDATA[No threats, no ,‚Äù who do you think you are?‚Äù Nothing but love and support. And @SonySantaMonica has never said a word about the delay, and what caused it. Studios are assholes, but this company from top to bottom, should give us hope. What they did for the crew is way more‚Ä¶ 

That I can‚Äôt talk about, but I‚Äôve said to all involved, it‚Äôs not he classiest thing that ive EVER heard about in this business.  Everyone involved in the GofW franchise puts their hearts and souls in every frame you see. I want thank everyone that‚Äôs has allowed me to play‚Ä¶

And laugh, and love, and cry, without judgement, but with unconditional support and love, in this thing of ALL OF OURS <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2764.png" alt="‚ù§" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2764.png" alt="‚ù§" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2764.png" alt="‚ù§" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2764.png" alt="‚ù§" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
