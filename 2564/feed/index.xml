	Comments on: Diablo Resurrected &#8211; Strange visual glitch on PS4 ( Look at darker section below statue, the Black and Grey squares ). These are all over the screen and very distracting in darker areas.	</title>

					<description><![CDATA[In this picture just look in the darker areas around the fog.  You&#039;ll see the squares pretty easily.  

They are static while you move around so it gives the picture a very muddy / strange look when moving.  

Not sure what this is but it is something I thought I saw in an earlier section but it was very dim and one of those things that makes you wonder if you are just seeing things.  But now I&#039;m in this area and they are very noticeable and very distracting.  

No this does not show up in Legacy mode]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Looks like its just the floors continuing on, I&#039;ve never played this game but I feel like this is intended for whatever reason. That reason I can&#039;t give you because I haven&#039;t played!]]></description>
