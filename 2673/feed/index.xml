					<description><![CDATA[Good game?

I started playing it then abandoned it for no good reason. I was enjoying it. Just got distracted by other multiplayer games. I think I&#039;ll get back to it when I&#039;m inclined to take on a single player campaign. It seems that I abandon all single player campaigns for the last couple of years, with the exception of TLOU 2.

The DLC looks well received too I think]]></description>
